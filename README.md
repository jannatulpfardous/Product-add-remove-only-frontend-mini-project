## INTRO TO MAKEUP ARTISTRY
Inglot Cosmetics is a Polish cosmetics company headquartered in Przemy≈õl, south-eastern Poland, specializing in the manufacturing of make-up products. It is considered among the most successful makeup companies in the world

### EYEBROW
Eyebrow pencils, creams, waxes, gels, and powders are used to color, fill in, and define the brows..


### Foundation 
Foundation is a cream, liquid, mousse or powder product applied to the entirety of the face to create a smooth and even base in the user's skin tone. Foundation provides a generally lower amount of coverage than concealer, and is sold in formulations that can provide sheer, matte, dewy or full coverage to the skin.


### Eyeshadow
Eyeshadow is a powder, cream or liquid pigmented product used to draw attention to, accentuate and change the shape of the area around the eyes, on the eyelid and the space below the eyebrows. Eyeshadow is typically applied using an eyeshadow brush, with generally small and rounded bristles, though liquid and cream formulations may also be applied with the fingers.


### Nail polish
Nail polish is a liquid used to colour the fingernails and toenails.[4] Transparent, colorless nail polishes may be used to strengthen nails or be used as a top or base coat to protect the nail or nail polish. Nail polish, like eyeshadow, is available in almost every colour and a number of different finishes, including matte, shimmer, glossy and crackle finishes.


### Face powder
Face powder, setting powder, or setting sprays are used to 'set' foundation or concealer, giving it a matte or consistent finish whilst also concealing small flaws or blemishes. Both powders and setting sprays claim to keep makeup from absorbing into the skin or melting off.
